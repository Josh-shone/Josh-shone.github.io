               I'm Joshua Shone, a current 3rd year Games Technology student at the University of the West of England. I'm 21 and I am continuing to work towards getting the best grade possible in my degree.<br><br>
               Whilst still trying to gain expertise in all areas of games development, looking forwards, I would like to start specialising in level design. With my extensive playtime in competitive games,
                and already having experience creating competitive maps, I feel like I should aim for that area of level design, however I know I should never box myself in as a developer.
                 Therefore, I will try to take every step in trying to make myself the most complete games developer as possible.
